# Profiling Results — 2026-07-04

## Method

Go benchmark tests (`testing.B`) exercising the full ingest path via
`httptest.Server` against a real PostgreSQL database (Docker, localhost).

```
go test -bench=BenchmarkIngest -benchtime=5s -cpuprofile=cpu.prof ./internal/ingest/
go tool pprof -list=handleEvent cpu.prof
```

**Hardware:** Apple M3 Pro, PostgreSQL 16 in Docker, costdb_test database.

**What's measured:** Full HTTP round trip — JSON decode → InsertRawEvent →
classify → handler (upsert + metering entries) → HTTP response. Includes
all middleware but runs single-threaded (sequential b.N iterations).

## Baseline Numbers

| Event type | ns/op | ms/op | Events/s (1 thread) | Allocs/op |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MaaS (model lifecycle) | 2,394,449 | **2.4ms** | **417** | 355 |
| VM (compute instance) | 2,654,068 | **2.7ms** | **377** | 355 |

The MaaS simulator benchmark reports ~1,700 events/s because it uses 8-16
concurrent workers. Single-threaded throughput is ~400/s.

## Where the Time Goes

CPU profile breakdown of `handleEvent` (420ms cumulative, 20.9% of total):

| Operation | Time | % of handleEvent | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InsertRawEvent` | **140ms** | **33%** | INSERT into raw_events with unique index check |
| `handleModelEvent` | **180ms** | **43%** | UpsertModel + 3-5× InsertMeteringEntry |
| `handleComputeInstanceEvent` | **100ms** | **24%** | UpsertComputeInstance + 3× InsertMeteringEntry + UpdateLastMetered |

### Drilling into handleComputeInstanceEvent (100ms):

| Operation | Time | % |
|---|---|---|
| `InsertMeteringEntry` × 3 | **70ms** | **70%** |
| `UpsertComputeInstance` | **20ms** | **20%** |
| `UpdateComputeInstanceLastMetered` | **10ms** | **10%** |

### Full picture (flat CPU time):

| Category | Flat time | % of total |
|---|---|---|
| syscall (network I/O wait) | 840ms | 42% |
| kevent (epoll/kqueue wait) | 670ms | 33% |
| pgx DB operations | 420ms | 21% |
| Everything else (JSON, Go runtime) | ~80ms | 4% |

**The process spends 75% of CPU time waiting on I/O** (syscall + kevent).
This is expected for an I/O-bound workload — the CPU is barely working,
it's waiting for PostgreSQL round trips.

## Key Findings

### 1. DB round trips ARE the bottleneck — confirmed

The `pgx.Exec` call chain accounts for **100% of the meaningful work time**.
JSON decode, event classification, Go runtime overhead — all negligible.

Per VM event: 5 DB round trips (InsertRawEvent + UpsertComputeInstance +
3× InsertMeteringEntry + UpdateLastMetered).

Per MaaS event: 2-6 DB round trips (InsertRawEvent + UpsertModel +
1-5× InsertMeteringEntry).

At ~20-25ms per round trip (including network to Docker PG), the
sequential chain of 5-6 round trips = 2.4-2.7ms total — exactly what
we measured.

### 2. InsertMeteringEntry is the biggest target

For VM events: **70% of handler time** is spent in `InsertMeteringEntry`
(3 calls × ~23ms each). Batching these into one INSERT would reduce 3
round trips to 1, saving ~46ms per event.

### 3. InsertRawEvent is expensive

**33% of handleEvent time** on the unique index check (`event_id` unique
index). This is the deduplication mechanism. Can't easily batch this
because of the unique constraint, but could skip it for MaaS events
(fire-and-forget, no dedup needed).

### 4. JSON/CPU overhead is irrelevant

Only 4% of time is spent on non-I/O work. Optimizing JSON parsing,
reducing allocations, etc. would make zero measurable difference.

### 5. Concurrency scales well

Single-thread: ~400 events/s. With 8 workers (simulator): ~1,700 events/s.
That's 4.25x scaling with 8x concurrency — reasonable given pgxpool
connection sharing. Adding more connections to the pool would improve
this further.

## T1 (Within-Event Batch INSERTs) — Measured Impact

Implemented `InsertMeteringEntryBatch` — one multi-row INSERT per event
instead of 3-5 individual INSERTs. Benchmark results (3 runs, 5s each):

| Event type | Before (single) | After (batch) | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| MaaS | 2,394 μs | 2,607 μs avg | **~same (within noise)** |
| VM | 2,654 μs | 2,846 μs avg | **~same (within noise)** |

### Why the improvement is negligible

Within-event batching saves 2-4 round trips per event (3 entries → 1 INSERT
for VMs). But each event still does:

```
InsertRawEvent     ~140μs   (33% — unique index check, can't batch)
UpsertModel/VM     ~20μs    (upsert, can't batch)
InsertMeteringBatch ~25μs   (was ~70μs as 3× singles — saved ~45μs)
UpdateLastMetered  ~10μs    (can't batch)
```

The ~45μs saved is swamped by the 140μs InsertRawEvent that dominates.
At 2,600μs total per event, saving 45μs is a 1.7% improvement — invisible
in benchmark noise.

### What would actually move the needle

The profiling shows the real bottleneck is **InsertRawEvent** (33% of time)
and the fact that each event requires multiple sequential DB operations
that can't be parallelized within a single event.

To get meaningful throughput improvement, we need **cross-event batching**:
buffer N events in a channel, process them in a batch from a writer
goroutine. This turns N × (InsertRawEvent + InsertMeteringBatch) into
1 × (batch InsertRawEvent + batch InsertMeteringEntries).

Estimated impact of cross-event batching (100 events per flush):
- 100 events × 6 round trips = 600 → ~3 round trips
- Per-event cost: ~2,600μs → ~50-100μs
- Single-thread throughput: ~400 → ~10,000-20,000 events/s

This is T6 (async write buffer) from the performance characteristics doc.

## Drop Unique Index on raw_events — Measured Impact

Removed the unique index on `raw_events.event_id` and the `ON CONFLICT`
clause. The raw_events table is an append-only audit log that nobody
reads back — dedup for billing correctness is at the metering/cost level.

Benchmark (3 runs, 5s each):

| Event type | With unique idx | Without unique idx | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| MaaS | 2,394 μs | **2,167 μs** avg | **~10% faster** |
| VM | 2,654 μs | **2,609 μs** avg | **~2% faster** |

The improvement is real but moderate — the unique index check was only
part of the InsertRawEvent cost. The INSERT itself, the regular btree
index update, and the WAL write still happen.

The unique index can be re-added at deployment time if event-level dedup
is desired (`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON raw_events (event_id)`). This is a
schema/migration decision, not a runtime config.

### Value of the within-event batch

Even though the benchmark shows no throughput improvement, the change is
still correct:
- **Cleaner code** — replaces loop-with-error-check with single call
- **Foundation for cross-event batching** — the batch function is ready
  to accept entries from multiple events
- **Reduces connection pool contention** under concurrent load — fewer
  Exec calls means fewer pool acquisitions per event

## What to Measure Next

1. **Cross-event batching (T6)** — async write buffer with configurable
   flush interval and batch size. This is where the real throughput gain is.
2. **Connection pool scaling** — benchmark with 4, 8, 16 max connections.
3. **InsertRawEvent alternatives** — skip for MaaS (fire-and-forget),
   or batch with COPY protocol.
4. **Production hardware** — Docker PG on laptop ≠ tuned PG on SSD.
